## Repository Organization
This repo is organized in four parts:
1. Blind Study
2. Code
3. Dataset Files
4. Results

### Blind Study
The files in the blind study folder contain all the files used in a very limited blind study. The purpose of the blind study was to validate if participants could identify an exercise based on a description of how to perform it.

### Code
The code folder contains all the code used for this project. Due to the amount of time between the publication date of the paper and the creation of this repository, it is unclear whether or not more code was used. If more code was written for this work, it has not been found.

### Dataset Files
This folder contains parse trees of each exercise found in the "good" and "bad" exercise datasets as well as a list of all the exercises and then the "good" and "bad" instructions for each exercise in the dataset.

### Results
The results folder contains all results found. Please note that these results simply represent results found from the preliminary research and may not reflect the results listed in the published paper.

### Cite Us
If using this work, we hope that you'll throw a citation our way if you found it useful.
